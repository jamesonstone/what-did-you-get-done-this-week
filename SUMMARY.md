Quick Start

# Clone and setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesonstone/what-did-you-get-done-this-week.git
cd what-did-you-get-done-this-week
```

# Start local development

`make dev-setup`

# Create your first user

`./bin/cli user sign up your-email@example.com`

# Check MailHog for emails

open `http://localhost:8025`

The implementation follows all your requirements exactly:

- Backend-only with no frontend
- Email templates with terminal-style formatting
- Proper timezone handling with IANA identifiers
- LLM integration for weekly summaries with cost tracking
- Robust email parsing with fallback clarification requests
- Production-ready AWS infrastructure with Terraform
